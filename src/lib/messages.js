  "Just here to donate your $10 again this week?",
  "Are you sure about that pick? My dog could do better.",
  "Good luck, you're gonna need it.",
  "I've seen better picks on a broken guitar.",
  "Choosing an underdog? Bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off.",
  "Is your mascot making your picks for you this week?",
  "I haven't seen a strategy that bold since my team went for it on 4th and long... from their own 20.",
  "You might want to check the weather report; it's looking like a storm of bad decisions for your lineup.",
  "I've seen more convincing offenses in a peewee league.",
  "Are you trying to win the 'most creative loss' award?",
  "That pick is more questionable than a noon kickoff in November.",
  "I had a nightmare last night that my picks looked like yours.",
  "My grandma, who only watches for the marching bands, could have made better selections.",
  "I'm not saying your picks are bad, but the officials are thinking of throwing a flag on them for illegal procedure.",
  "Did you accidentally draft a list of 'teams that will be down by 21 at the half'?",
  "That's an interesting strategy. It's like you're punting on the first down of this challenge.",
  "Are you getting your analysis from a Magic 8-Ball?",
  "Your team is about to have more turnovers than a bakery.",
  "I'm starting to think you just pick teams based on which uniform color you like best.",
  "That lineup has 'moral victory' written all over it.",
  "Are you sure you didn't fill this out after the tailgate started?",
  "I've seen better game plans on the back of a napkin.",
  "Your picks are about as reliable as a kicker from the 20-yard line.",
  "You're swinging for the fences, but it looks more like you're going to strike out.",
  "I'm not one to judge, but even your team's biggest rival wouldn't make those picks.",
